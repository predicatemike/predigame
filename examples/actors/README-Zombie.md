How do I?
-----
It's possible to take a game in a number of different directions. This guide walks through some common **use cases** and the underlying code that would be required for implementation.

# Background Images

## Static Backgrounds
This code will provide a single image that is used in ever level. You'll want to add to your setup function.
```python
   background('grass')
```
You can also just have single color. Here is an example of a gray background.
```python
   background(GRAY)
```
If you have a particular color in mind, it's possible to also define the background with a `(red, green, blue)` tuple.
```python
   background((25, 25, 25)
```
## Random Backgrounds
If you interested in changing backgrounds for each level, we'll want to create a list with all of our choices and then use the `choice()` function to randomly select an image file from the list.
```python
   choices = ['grass', 'ville']
   background(choice(choices))
```
We also have a pretty cool image service that will randomly pick and use a background from the Internet. This can add a little jazz to your game.
```python
   background()
```
## Progressive Backgrounds
Sometimes you'll want to have the same background be used for the same level. This can provide a hint to the user of where they are in the game. In order to accomplish progressive backgrounds, we'll need to evaluate the level and decide which background image to load. Using python, we can accomplish this with an if/else statement.
```python
   if level_number == 1:
      background('grass')
   elif level_number == 2:
      background('ville')
   else:
      background('stormy')
```
Notice that the file line is the "catch all" statement. This basically means the same `stormy` image will be used for the third and beyond levels.

# Mazes

## Generated Maze
It's possible, also within the `setup` function, to define the type of maze should be drawn on the game service. Assuming that there is an image with the name `'stone'`, it's possible to use that to draw the maze.
```python
   maze(callback=partial(image, 'stone'))
```
Likewise, it's also possibly to simply draw a maze with colors. For example, 
```python
   maze(callback=partial(shape, RECT, BLACK))
```
## Random Maze
Sometimes it may be desirable to have some randomly placed blocks to create as obstacles. It's possible to tweak the `2.75` number to draw more or less blocks. The numbers `19` and `31` signify the HEIGHT and WIDTH of the window, in terms of grid cells.
```python
   for y in range(19):
      for x in range(31):
         if rand(1, 3) > 2.75:
            shape(RECT, RED, (x, y), tag='wall')
```
## Add Walls
This code will register callbacks for the `w`, `a`,`s`, and `d` keys. The put function a stone wall at the grid location next to the player. Run this code as part of `setup` since the code needs a reference to the player actor.
```python
   def __put__(player, direction):
      """ put a block at the player's next location  """
      pos = player.next(direction)
      image('stone', pos, tag = 'wall')

   keydown('w', callback=partial(__put__, player, BACK))
   keydown('a', callback=partial(__put__, player, LEFT))
   keydown('s', callback=partial(__put__, player, FRONT))
   keydown('d', callback=partial(__put__, player, RIGHT))
```

# Basic Weapons
The signature (function name) of each weapon will need to remain the same. These should be copied into the plugin code without indentation. All weapons have 100% lethality.

## Simple Air Shot
```python
def shoot(level, player):
   """ simple air shot """
   player.act(SHOOT, loop=1)
   target = player.next_object()

   if target and isinstance(target, Actor):
      target.kill()
```
## Simple Air Shot (that kills any sprite)
```python
def shoot(level, player):
   """ air shot that will kill any actor or sprite """
   player.act(SHOOT, loop=1)
   target = player.next_object()
   if target and isinstance(target, Actor):
      target.kill()
      level.hit()
   elif target and isinstance(target, Sprite):
      target.fade(0.5)
```
## Bullets (that kills any sprite) [HARD]
Challenges:
* try having bullets only destroy actors
* try changing the bullet image
```python
def shoot(level, player, repeat=False):
   """ shoot real bullets """
   player.act(SHOOT, loop=1)
   pos = player.facing()
   bpos = player.pos
   bullet = image('bullet', tag='bullet', pos=(bpos[0]+0.5, bpos[1]+0.5), size=0.3)
   bullet.speed(10).move_to((pos[0]+0.5,pos[1]+0.5))

   def __hit__(bullet, target):
      if target != player:
         bullet.destroy()
         if isinstance(target, Actor):
            target.kill()
         elif isinstance(target, Sprite):
            target.fade(0.5)
   bullet.collides(sprites(), __hit__)
```
At the very end of this function, it's possible to add a machine gun fire with the following lines:
```python
   if not repeat:
      callback(partial(shoot, level, player, True), wait=0.2, repeat=5)
```
Try changing the `wait` attributes. If it's too small you'll notice that the bullets collide with each other. Try also changing the `repeat` option for more bullets.

If the following line is removed, bullet will push through multiple objects, making it VERY LETHAL!!
```python
         bullet.destroy()
``` 


## Flame Thrower [EASY]
This one goes without any explanation. It's just really awesome. Keep in mind that the throw key is `1` on your keyboard.
```python
def throw(level, player, repeat=False):
   """ flame thrower """
   player.act(THROW, loop=1)
   pos = player.facing()
   bpos = player.pos
   beam = shape(ELLIPSE, RED, pos=(bpos[0]+0.5, bpos[1]+0.5), size=0.3)

   def __hit__(beam, target):
      if target != player:
         if isinstance(target, Actor):
            target.kill()
         elif isinstance(target, Sprite):
            target.fade(0.5)
   beam.collides(sprites(), __hit__)

   def __grow__(beam):
      beam.move_to(player.facing())
      beam.scale(1.1).speed(10)
      if beam.size > 20:
        beam.fade(1)

   if not repeat:
      callback(partial(__grow__, beam), wait=0.1, repeat=50)
```
## Throw a Punch [EASY]
```python
def punch(level, player):
   player.act(THROW, loop=1)
   target = at(player.next(player.direction))
   if isinstance(target, Actor):
       target.kill()
   elif isinstance(target, Sprite):
       target.fade(0.5)
```

# Friendlies
Your objective is to save the life of friendly forces.

   """ create a blue (friendly) actor """
   # return name of actor and grazing speed
   return 'Piggy', 0.75
```
## Make Friendlies Away from Hostiles(s)

# Hostiles
Your object is to eliminate all hostile actors.
```python
def get_red():
   """ create a red (hostile) actor """
   # return name of actor, movement speed
   return 'Zombie-1', 1
```
## Schedule More Hostiles

# Scoring

## Add  Countdown Timer
This code should be added to the end of the `setup` function. 
```python
   timer(color=WHITE, value=30)
 ```
If desired, it's also possible to add a countdown time that adds additional time for each level. The following code will add 30 seconds for each level.
```python
   timer(color=WHITE, value=30*level_number)
 ```
