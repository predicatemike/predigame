How do I?
-----
It's possible to take a game in a number of different directions. This guide walks through some common **use cases** and the underlying code that would be required for implementation.

# Computer Opponents

## Make Opponents Smart

**Objective:** Add (one or more) computer controlled players that want to find a player sprite.

## Single Target Opponent

## Make Opponents Move Away from Player(s) 


# Levels

# Mazes

## Creating Mazes
Create a maze based on stone images (this assumes you have a `stone.png` file saved in your images directory.
```python
maze(callback=partial(image, 'stone'))
```
Create a maze based on black rectangles:
```python
maze(callback=partial(shape, RECT, BLACK))
```



## Add Walls
This code will register callbacks for the `w`, `a`,`s`, and `d` keys. The put function a stone wall at the grid location next to the player. 
```python
def put(player, direction):
	""" put a block at the player's next location  """
	pos = player.next(direction)
	image('stone', pos, tag = 'wall')

keydown('w', callback=partial(put, player, BACK))
keydown('a', callback=partial(put, player, LEFT))
keydown('s', callback=partial(put, player, FRONT))
keydown('d', callback=partial(put, player, RIGHT))
```

## Destroy Walls
Allow a player to shoot and destroy any object, including a wall.

```python
def shoot():
	player.act(SHOOT, loop=1)

	target = player.next_object()
	if target and isinstance(target, Actor):
		target.kill()
	elif target:
		target.fade(0.5)

keydown('space', shoot)
```
# Weapons

## Shoot (real) Bullets
```python
def hit(bullet, obj):
	if obj != player:
		bullet.destroy()
		if isinstance(obj, Actor):
			obj.kill()
def shoot():
	player.act(SHOOT, loop=1)
	pos = player.facing()
	bpos = player.pos
	bullet = image('bullet', pos=(bpos[0]+0.5, bpos[1]+0.5), size=0.3)
	bullet.speed(10).move_to((pos[0]+0.5,pos[1]+0.5))
	bullet.collides(sprites(), hit)
keydown('space', shoot)
```
## Shoot Through Walls
```python
def hit(bullet, obj):
	if obj != player:
		if isinstance(obj, Actor):
			obj.kill()
		elif isinstance(obj, Sprite):
			obj.fade(0.25)

def shoot():
	player.act(SHOOT, loop=1)
	pos = player.facing()
	bpos = player.pos
	bullet = image('bullet', pos=(bpos[0]+0.5, bpos[1]+0.5), size=0.3)
	bullet.speed(10).move_to((pos[0]+0.5,pos[1]+0.5))
	bullet.collides(sprites(), hit)
keydown('space', shoot)
```
## Machine Gun Fire
Keep on firing until you stop. Load and then fire some more.
```python
def load():
	global stop
	stop = False

def stopit():
	global stop
	stop = True

def hit(bullet, obj):
	if obj != player:
		if isinstance(obj, Actor):
			obj.kill()
		elif isinstance(obj, Sprite):
			obj.fade(0.25)

def machine_gun():
	player.act(SHOOT, loop=1)
	pos = player.facing()
	bpos = player.pos
	bullet = image('bullet', pos=(bpos[0]+0.5, bpos[1]+0.5), size=0.3)
	bullet.speed(10).move_to((pos[0]+0.5,pos[1]+0.5))
	bullet.collides(sprites(), hit)
	if not stop:
		callback(machine_gun, 0.25)
```
## Throw a Punch

```python
player = actor('Soldier-2', pos=(1, 1), tag = 'player', abortable=True)
player.speed(2).keys()

def punch():
    player.act(THROW, loop=1)
    target = at(player.next(player.direction))
    if isinstance(target, Actor):
        target.kill()
    elif isinstance(target, Sprite):
        target.fade(0.5)

keydown('p', punch)
```

## Throw a Bomb

## Limiting Inventory

# Scoring

##  Add a countdown timer

**Objective:** Add a countdown timer that will stop a game when the timer reaches zero.

This is an example of a timer that will start at 30 seconds, count down every second (`step=-1`), stop at zero (`goal=0`), and call the `timer()` callback function when complete. Any scoring element may have a text prefix if desired, but that is optional.

```python
# simple countdown timer example

WIDTH = 30
HEIGHT = 20
TITLE = 'Countdown Timer Example'

def timer():
        text('GAME OVER')
        gameover()

score(30, pos=UPPER_LEFT, method=TIMER, step=-1, goal=0, callback=timer, prefix='Time Left:')
```

## Adjust a countdown timer

**Objective:** Reward the player with additional time for a particular accomplishment.
